## ✅ Python Project Development Rules

### 🐍 Environment Setup
- Always activate the virtual environment before running or installing anything:
  - `source venv/bin/activate` 
- Use `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies.
- Keep the `venv/` directory untracked in `.gitignore`.

### 🔐 Environment Variables & Secrets
- Store all credentials and sensitive configuration (API keys, tokens, etc.) in a `.env` file.
- Never commit `.env` to version control — add it to `.gitignore`.
- Use the `python-dotenv` package (or similar) to load environment variables safely in your scripts.

### 🧠 Workflow & Communication
- **Always ask for clarity before starting a new task or feature.**
- Break large tasks into clear, actionable steps.
- Track progress collaboratively in a `TASKS.md` file.
- Keep all assumptions, decisions, and blockers noted in context.

Use `TASKS.md` to plan and track your work like a mini project manager.
